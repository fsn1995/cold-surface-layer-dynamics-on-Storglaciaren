# Cold Surface Layer Dynamics of Storglaci√§ren, Northern Sweden 2009-2019
This is my master thesis and is open access at Uppsala University [DiVA, id: diva2: 1325748](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1325748) 2019-06-17. \
The model is provided by [Dr. Ward van Pelt](http://www.wardvanpelt.com/) with help of Dr. Sergey Marchenko. More detailed description and refernces can be found in my thesis. Here I am just collecting the MATLAB script for data preprocessing, visulizaito and analysis of results. 

## 1. snow stake measurements
(S1-S3) Convert snow stake readings and other mass balance survey data to solid precipitation data input. 
## 2. meteorological data
(S1, S2) Prepare the meteorological data from various sources to a complete time series data 
## 3. final preparation
(S1, S2) Final preparation of model input. Define initial conditions of the model
## 4. results
